Verse 1
G                    G
Strumming on my ukulele,
Am                   Am
trying to find the words,
D                     G
to express this feeling.
G                      D
It's like nothing I've ever heard.
G                    G
You're like a star in the sky,
Em                   C
shining so bright.
G                    G
But every time I reach for you,
D                    D
you fade into the night.


Chorus
G                    C        G
Why's it so hard to break through to you?
Em                   Em
I'm playing my heart out,
C                    G
what more can I do?
Em                   Em
You're a puzzle I can't solve,
D                    Em
a mystery so true.
Am                   Am
Regretting every moment,
C                    D
I didn't ask for you.


Verse 2
G                    Em
I finally mustered up the courage,
Em                   C
to ask you out one day.
G                    G
But you said you're busy,
G                    D
and my heart just slipped away.
G                    G
I should've asked for your number,
C                    Em
should've tried again.
C                    C
But now I'm left here wondering
D                    Em    D
what could've been!


Chorus
G                    C        G
Why's it so hard to break through to you?
Em                   Em
I'm playing my heart out,
C                    G
what more can I do?
Em                   Em
You're a puzzle I can't solve,
D                    Em
a mystery so true.
Am                   Am
Regretting every moment,
C                    D
I didn't ask for you.


Bridge
Em                   Em
Now I'm strumming here alone,
C                    G        D
under the moonlit sky.
Em                   C        G
Wishing I could turn back time and give it one more try.


Verse 3
D                    Em        C
But life's a song that keeps on playing,
D                    Em
even when we're apart.
Am                   Am
I'll keep singing this melody,
C                    D
hoping to mend my heart.
G                    G
Maybe one day you'll see me,
D                    Em        C
see the love in my eyes,
G                    G
And realize that I've been here,
D                    G
singing under the skies. Till then,
Em                   Em
I'll keep on playing,
C                    G
this ukulele of mine,
D                    D
Hoping one day you'll hear it,
C                    D
and our stars will align.


Chorus
G                    C        G
Why's it so hard to break through to you?
Em                   Em
I'm playing my heart out,
C                    G
what more can I do?
Em                   Em
You're a puzzle I can't solve,
D                    Em
a mystery so true.
Am                   Am
Regretting every moment,
C                    D
I didn't ask for you.


Outro
G                    Em
So I'll keep on playing this ukulele of mine.
Am                   D        G
Hoping one day you'll hear it and our stars will align.
